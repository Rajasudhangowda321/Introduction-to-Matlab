%To find speed =Distance/Time
%To convert meter to kilometer divide meter by 1000, therefore meter=100, 100/1000=0.1km
%To convert sec to hour divide by 60,here 1st second is coverted in hour
distance=0.1
time=2.66*10^-3
hundred=distance/time
km=42.195
hour=2.0275%here 1st 2:01:39 hours is converted into second and then it is converted into hour
marathon=km/hour
